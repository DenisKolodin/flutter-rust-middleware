# Middleware

Boilerplate code to patch Flutter with Rust on iOS and Android.

## Getting Started

The first thing you need to do is set a few environment variables to help the process.
```
export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/$USER/Library/Android/sdk

export NDK_HOME=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk-bundle
```

You also need to update the contents of `ndk.sh` and `build.sh` in the cargo folder so the paths
match your actual project directories

Then, you need to run the ndk script to build your compile targets from the root folder of the project

`./ndk.sh`

Next, change to the cargo directory

`cd cargo`

and run the build script

`./build.sh`

finally, you can build the project from the root directory of the project

```
For iOS:
  flutter build iOS

For Android:
  flutter build apk
```


# TODO
- Change Hello World to JSON string containing method and arguments
- Deserialize and Serialize on both ends
- Streamline where possible
- Turn into flutter library if it's possible to include the cross building process
